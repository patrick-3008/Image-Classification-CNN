# Image Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates the implementation of an image classification pipeline using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and training a CNN model on the dataset.

- Model Training

## Imports
All the necessary libraries for data loading, preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation are imported at the beginning of the notebook.

## Read Dataset
The dataset is loaded into the notebook for further processing. Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory or provide the appropriate path.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning steps are applied to prepare the dataset for training. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and other preprocessing tasks.

## Data Visualization
A histogram is generated to visualize the distribution of the dataset. This helps in understanding the data characteristics.

## Model Training
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the preprocessed data. The training process includes:
- Model architecture definition
- Compilation with appropriate loss function and optimizer
- Training the model on the dataset

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Place the dataset in the specified directory or update the dataset path in the notebook.
4. Run the notebook step by step to execute the pipeline.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras
- scikit-learn

## Results
The trained CNN model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. Details are available in the notebook.
